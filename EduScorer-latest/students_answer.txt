The Industrial Revolution was a pivotal time in the 19th century, primarily driven by the advent of machines and factories. This period saw the rapid growth of industrialization and the mass migration of people to cities. The mechanization of production processes replaced handcrafting and ushered in a new era of manufacturing.

The consequences of this revolution were mixed. On one hand, it led to economic growth and technological progress. Factories, railways, and steam engines were invented, revolutionizing transportation and industry. However, it also brought about societal problems like overcrowding in cities and exploitation of labor, particularly child labor.

In summary, the Industrial Revolution had both positive and negative outcomes, impacting society, the economy, and the environment.
